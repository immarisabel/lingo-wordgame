 # Lingo Word Game
 ## Project 01
 ### NOV 26, 2020

This is my first repository. I am totally new to this, so ignore most here unless you think I can learn from it.


*(these notes are for me to use as reference of my learning and keep the code clean once something is fixed.*

### Week 1 Notes:

[] need to be able to restart game
[] game does not run after letter input, not crash, not end
[x] cuts tries remaining at +1
[x] cuts attempts at half the tries
[x] does not counts how many attempts are left
[x] it does not run the rest of the game.
[x] loops infinite when you write non-int elements
[x] still crashes on other input.
[x] jump to end of game with other numbers.
