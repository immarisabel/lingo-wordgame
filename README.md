 # Lingo Word Game
 ## Project 01
 ### NOV 26, 2020

This is my first repository. I am totally new to this, so ignore most here unless you think I can learn from it.


*(these notes are for me to use as reference of my learning and keep the code clean once something is fixed.*

# challenges to fix
### Week 1 Notes:

- [x] need to be able to restart game
- [x] cuts tries remaining at +1
- [x] cuts attempts at half the tries
- [x] does not counts how many attempts are left
- [x] it does not run the rest of the game.
- [x] loops infinite when you write non-int elements
- [x] still crashes on other input.
- [x] jump to end of game with other numbers.

### DEC 3, 2020
- [ ] game does not run after letter input, not crash, not end, just shows blank and game stops
- *will postpone fixing this until the end as using GUI might fix this by limiting selection of options*

- [ ] when repeating the game, the same word is always chosen.

### DEC 4, 2020
- [x] won't repeat game after it ends, again. [10 DEC]

### DEC 5, 2020
- *spent most day trying to fix the restart loop without success...*

- [x] levels were backwards :sweat_smile: [DEC 5]
- [ ] replace end booleans with actual strings

### DEC 10, 2020
- :pencil2: *I managed to run the restart game loop! It was simple... I was just ignoring converting the answer into Boolean! Now I still need to fix the random word to actually reset.*

# planned implementation
- [ ] be able to play as many times as you wish
- [ ] have a big word list to choose from
		- *word list in files, but will replace it at the end, else it is annoying to test with so many words*
- [ ] hints
- [ ] create categories of words
- [ ] multiplayer function
- [ ] scoring system
- [ ] store the player's progress and scores
- [ ] GUI
